# HTool Project: iOS/macOS Reverse Engineering Tool

![HTool macOS](https://github.com/h3adshotzz/htoolv3/actions/workflows/main_macos.yml/badge.svg?branch=working) ![HTool Linux](https://github.com/h3adshotzz/htoolv3/actions/workflows/main_linux.yml/badge.svg?branch=working)

HTool is a command-line static analysis and reverse engineering tool supporting Mach-O binaries and a range of iOS, macOS and other Darwin-based OS firmware files. HTool provides a Mach-O parser, firmware file analyser and disassembler.

HTool inherits much of it's Mach-O functionality from Libhelper, while a new library - Libarch - was developed primarily for HTool to provide it a small, lightweight and extremely fast ARM AArch64 disassembler.

HTool is a closed-source project license under the Is This On? Confidential and Proprietary License (v1), with the development primarily, at this stage, for the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science for myself.
