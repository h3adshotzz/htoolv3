\section{Introduction}

The problem in which I am attempting to solve in my project is the lack of tools available for handling, parsing and reverse engineering firmware files on Apple platforms such as iOS, iPadOS and macOS.

Currently there is a distinct lack of available applications or tools that can handle all of these firmware files, instead it's a mix of different tools that are published either on Github or kept closed-source, and aren't routinely updated.

The solutions that do exist are, again, not regularly updated - such as JTool[1], or extremely expensive - such as IDA64[2].
