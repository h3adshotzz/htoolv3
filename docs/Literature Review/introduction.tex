My project, named HTool, will attempt to solve a problem posed by the lack of available tools for statically analysing, parsing and reverse engineering binaries and firmware files on Apple's iOS, macOS and derived Operating Systems.

This heavily relates to my chosen field of study, Software Engineering, as the resulting artefact will be a complex application able to handle a range of different firmware file formats and static analysis functionality. 

Currently there is a distinct lack of available applications or tools for this purpose. The two main tools, JTool\cite{jtool} and IDA64\cite{ida64}, are either no longer updated or extremely expensive. Apart for highly specific tools available on Github, there is not a great deal of available tools, particularly for people new to security research on Apple platforms.

This essay will cover the primary areas and file formats the project should support, and analyse available research or literature for those areas.
