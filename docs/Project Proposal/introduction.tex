\section{Introduction}

With my project I am proposing to develop a command-line tool - named HTool - for assisting in the static aanlysis and reverse engineering of the firmware files of Apple's Darwin-based Operating Systems, primarily iOS and macOS.

The problem which HTool is attempting to solve is the current lack of comprehensive, free and up-to-date software for reverse engineering iOS/macOS firwmare files specifically. 

Currently, there are two types of tools. The first being those shipped as part of Xcode Developer Tools (taken from LLVM), and third party tools, like JTool. 

The problems with the standard LLVM tools are that they are just general debugging tools, there is no iOS-specific functionality. Plus they must first be updated and approved in the LLVM project, and then shipped as part of macOS, so typically only add functionality in major OS versions released every Autumn,

The issues with the currently available third party tools like JTool are that they are either no longer updated, not opensource, or have a very narrow scope/functionality. 

A secondary problem that I hope to address is the implementation of a interactive analysis and disassembly mode for HTool, this type of feature is not offered in existing solutions such as JTool.
